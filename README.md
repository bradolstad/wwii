# WW2 App

## What problem are we solving
Right now, there's no real web interface for looking through WW2 data. Everything out there is outdated / not usable.

We want to make something that allows users to look at / view the events of WW2 in the easiest way possible. In a storytelling format.

## Requirements
* Need to be able to go into granular detail of an area on the map.
* Individual events on an atlas down to the month.
* Follow a company around.

## Minimum Viable Product
* 1 company
* follow the events of 1 company
* events should show the different companies involved
* events should also show the different campaigns that were involved
* social (commenting system?)
* search bar? (optional)

## Feel
* Browned out WW2 map era feeling
* show divisions, number of types of divisions, casualties
* Documentary-esque
* Story telling on a company basis.
* Companies
* Comrades
* Follow your company
* War
* Forces
* Map
* Campaign
